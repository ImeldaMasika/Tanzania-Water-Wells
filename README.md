# Tanzania-Water-Wells
Tanzanian Water Well Crisis: The aim of this project is to build a model which tells the status of the water points (as functional, nonfunctional, functional but needs repair). With this model, we will help to the Tanzanian authorities how to use water sources as a productive way. It also helps the investment of the government on wells.
